MoveFloor
---------
* This block is only available if mesecons and mesecons_mvps is loaded.

The MoveFloor block responds to a mesecons power source in the 4 horizontal
directions. If the power source is one higher the MoveFloor moves up to
that height. If the power source is one lower the MoveFloor moves down to
that height. Powering an adjacent block has no effect. The power source
should be turned off before another move or the MoveFloor will oscillate.

Any horizontally adjoining MoveFloor acts as a single block (only one
needs to be powered).

The MoveFloor will move up to 3 blocks stacked on it.

If using a DigiSwitch as the power source use the side name "switch" or
the MoveFloor will not move.
