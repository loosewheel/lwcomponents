DigiSwitch
----------
* This block is only available if both digilines and mesecons are loaded.

Digiswitches act as both a digilines message target and a digilines cable,
as well as a mesecons power source. They can be placed beside each other
to form a bank, horizontally or vertically.

Right click the digiswitch to give it a channel.

Mesecon power can be delivered at 6 sides of the digiswitch, the adjacent
4 in the (x, z), above and below. Around the connector on these sides are a
colored border indicating the side. The sides are named "red", "green",
"blue", "yellow", "white" and "black".

The digilines message sent to the digiswitch dictates the action, "on" or
"off". The action can be followed with the side to act upon, separated by
a space. eg. "on white". If a side is stated only that side is acted upon.
If the side is omitted (or is invalid) all 6 sides are acted upon. If the
side name "switch" is give the power is supplied the same as a mesecons
switch (all horizontal sides, one below, this height and one above).
