Deployer
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Deployers place the node up to 5 nodes directly in front of them. The
node is only placed if there are no nodes before of it which are not
replaceable. ie. cannot place 2nd node if 1st node has something in it.
Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will
take items from the top and sides, and release them from the bottom.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

UI

Channel - digilines channel of breaker.
Top 16 slot inventory - storage of items to place.
Bottom 32 slot inventory - player's inventory.

Mesecons
	Places the node in front (always the 1st node position) when power is
	turned on, if it can.

Digilines messages

"deploy  <slot or itemname> <n>"
	Places the node at n nodes in front when power is turned on, if it can.
	n should be a number between 1 and 5. If omitted 1 is assumed.

	If slot is a number, places an item from that slot. No placement if
	slot is empty.
	eg. "deploy 7"

	If itemname is given, places the item of the name given. No placement
	if deployer does not contain the item.
	eg. "deploy default:stone"

	If n is given with no slot/itemname use "nil".
	eg. "deploy nil 3"

When a deployer places a node a digilines message is sent with the
deployer's channel. The message is a table with the following
keys:
{
	action = "deploy",
	name = "<name>",
	slot = <slot>,
	range = <number>
}

action
	Will be "deploy".

name
	The registered node name of what was placed.

range
	The nodes forward that was placed.
