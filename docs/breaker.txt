Breaker
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Breakers dig the node up to 5 nodes directly in front of them and drop
the item at the back of them. The node is only dug if the breaker has a
tool that can dig it or if it can be dug by hand, and there are no nodes
before of it. ie. cannot dig 2nd node if 1st node has something in it.
The tool is worn if used. Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the
hopper mod is loaded, will take tools from the top and sides.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.
