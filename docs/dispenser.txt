Dispenser

* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will take
items from the top and sides, and release them from the bottom.

To spawn entities from dispensers include the lwcomponents_spawners mod.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

Digilines messages

"dispense"
	Dispenses the next item. No dispense if dispenser is empty.

"dispense <slot>"
	Dispenses 1 item from the given slot (1 to 16). No dispense if slot is
	empty.
	eg. "dispense 7"

"dispense <itemname>"
	Dispenses 1 item of the given name. No dispense if dispenser does not
	contain the item.
	eg. "dispense default:stone"

When an item is dropped a digilines message is sent with the dropper's
channel. The message is a table with the following keys:
{
	action = "dispense",
	name = "<itemname>", -- name of dropped item
	slot = <slot> -- slot number the item was taken from (1 to 16).
}
